In the realm of data-driven decision-making, understanding your customer base is paramount for businesses seeking to thrive in today's competitive landscape. The "Customers" table, which houses a wealth of customer-related data, serves as a valuable resource for deriving actionable insights. This table encompasses data on customer demographics. Leveraging this data effectively can drive informed business strategies, enhance customer experiences, and ultimately lead to sustainable growth.

To create a comprehensive Customer Analysis Dashboard, we aim to accomplish the following objective:

Customer Demographic Analysis:

Segment and visualize customer data based on demographic attributes such as age, gender, and location (city, state, country).
Provide an overview of the distribution of customers across these demographic categories.

By accomplishing this objective, we aim to create a Customer Analysis Dashboard that empowers our organization to make data-driven decisions, enhance customer experiences, and drive business growth. This dashboard will serve as a valuable tool for understanding and optimizing our customer relationships.
