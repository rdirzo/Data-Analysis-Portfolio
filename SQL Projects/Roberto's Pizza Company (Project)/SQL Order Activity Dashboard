#To begin creating our 'Orders Activity' dashboard we must include some key information
on the customers, item ordered, address, quantity, etc. This information will be pulled
from different tables, therefore we will need to use a LEFT JOIN command to properly execute
this task.

SELECT
	o.order_id,
	i.item_price,
	o.quantity,
	i.item_cat,
	i.item_name,
	o.created_at,
	a.delivery_address1,
	a.delivery_address2,
	a.delivery_city,
	a.delivery_zipcode,
	o.delivery 
FROM
	orders o
	LEFT JOIN item i ON o.item_id = i.item_id
	LEFT JOIN address a ON o.add_id = a.add_id

This code is asking the database to provide a list of orders, including 
details like what items were ordered in each order, the price of those items,when the order was made, 
and where it should be delivered. It's like getting a summary of all the orders made, what they contain, 
and where they need to be sent.
