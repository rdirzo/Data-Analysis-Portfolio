Introduction:

In this database query and analysis task, our objective is to extract critical information related to ingredient inventory and customer orders. By doing so, we aim to gain insights into both our stock management and customer order fulfillment processes. This analysis is essential for optimizing inventory levels, understanding customer preferences, and ensuring efficient order processing.

Objectives:


For the First Query (Order Activity):

Retrieve Order Information: The first part of this code focuses on retrieving vital information related to customer orders. This includes details such as order IDs, item prices, quantities ordered, item categories, item names, order creation timestamps, delivery addresses, and delivery statuses.

Data Integration: The code uses "LEFT JOIN" statements to combine data from multiple tables, including "orders," "item," and "address," based on common identifiers like item IDs and address IDs. This integration allows us to create a consolidated view of customer orders, including item details and delivery addresses.




For the Second Query (Ingredient Inventory):

Retrieve Ingredient Information: The primary goal of the second part of this code is to retrieve detailed information about ingredients, such as their names, ordered weights, individual weights, and the total weight of each ingredient in inventory.

Inventory Quantity: Obtain data on the quantity of each ingredient currently in inventory. This information is crucial for effective inventory management and ensuring that we have sufficient supplies to meet customer orders.

Calculate Total Inventory Weight: By multiplying the individual weight of each ingredient by its quantity in inventory, we can calculate the total weight of each ingredient in our inventory. This calculation helps assess the overall weight of our inventory items and plan for restocking as needed.

Data Grouping: The data will be organized by grouping it based on ingredient names and IDs. Grouping simplifies the analysis by consolidating information for each unique ingredient.

Table Joins: The code utilizes "LEFT JOIN" statements to combine data from multiple tables, including "stock1," "inventory," and "ingredient," based on common identifiers, such as ingredient IDs. This integration ensures that we have a comprehensive view of our ingredient inventory.


By accomplishing these objectives, we aim to enhance our inventory management practices, identify potential restocking needs for ingredients, and gain insights into customer orders, which will help us streamline order processing and improve overall operational efficiency.
