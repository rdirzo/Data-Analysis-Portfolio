#To find ways to manage our costs more effienciently, we must understand the costs of goods sold 
by breaking down each cost of our ingredients used.

select
s2.ing_name,
s2.ordered_weight,
ing.ing_weight,
inv.quantity,
ing.ing_weight * inv.quantity AS total_inv_weight 
FROM
	( SELECT ing_id, ing_name, sum( ordered_weight ) AS ordered_weight FROM stock1 GROUP BY ing_name, ing_id ) s2
	LEFT JOIN inventory inv ON inv.item_id = s2.ing_id
	LEFT JOIN ingredient ing ON ing.ing_id = s2.ing_id

So, in simple terms, this code is asking the database to give us a list that shows the names of ingredients, 
how much of each ingredient was ordered, the weight of each ingredient, how much of each ingredient is in inventory, 
and the total weight of each ingredient in inventory. It's like getting a report on the ingredients 
used in a pizza place to manage their stock and orders.
